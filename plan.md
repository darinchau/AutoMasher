# Frontend

The frontend web demo should be a one-page easy-to-use interface that allows users to put in a song and get our mashups.

The user should be able to input a song by either uploading an audio file or by providing a link to a song on YouTube. The system should be able to show a thumbnail and an audio preview of the song that the user has inputted.

After the user has inputted a song. The user should then be able to click a button to generate a mashup. The system should then display a personalized link to download the mashup.

The user should also be able to access a dropdown menu that gives them more control to the mashup config.

# Backend

The backend should be a REST API that takes in a song, and a mashup config. The API should then return a link to download the mashup.
